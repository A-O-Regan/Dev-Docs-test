# Cork City (Note: this was added using Dev-Doc AI)

Cork City, located in the south of Ireland, is the country's second-largest city and the largest urban area in the province of Munster. Known for its rich history, vibrant culture, and friendly inhabitants, Cork has earned the nickname "The Rebel City" due to its role in various Irish independence movements. The city is built on the River Lee, which splits into two channels, creating an island in the city center. Cork boasts a thriving food scene, with the English Market being a particular highlight, offering local and artisanal produce. The city is also home to University College Cork, contributing to its youthful and dynamic atmosphere. Visitors can explore numerous historical sites, including St. Fin Barre's Cathedral and the Cork City Gaol, or enjoy the lively music and arts scene that permeates the city's many pubs, theaters, and galleries.
